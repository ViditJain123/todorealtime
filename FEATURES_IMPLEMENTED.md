# Realtime Todo App - Sharing & Websocket Features

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 📤 Share Lists with Other Users via Email

**Features:**
- ✅ Share button on each todo list card
- ✅ Email validation modal that checks if user exists in Clerk
- ✅ Backend API that validates email and adds user to `sharedWith` array
- ✅ Shared lists appear in both owner's and shared user's dashboard
- ✅ Full read/write permissions for all shared users

**How to Use:**
1. Click the share button (📤) on any list card
2. Enter the email address of a registered user
3. Click "Share" - the system will validate the email exists in Clerk
4. The list will now appear on both users' dashboards

### 🔄 Real-Time Sync via WebSockets

**Features:**
- ✅ Live todo updates across all users with access to a list
- ✅ Real-time synchronization for:
  - Adding new todos
  - Updating todo status/priority/text
  - Deleting todos
  - Toggling completion status
- ✅ Users automatically join list "rooms" when viewing a list
- ✅ Immediate UI updates without page refresh

**Technical Implementation:**
- Socket.io server integrated with Next.js
- Client-side socket context provider
- Room-based messaging (one room per list)
- Local state updates for immediate feedback
- Graceful fallback if WebSocket connection fails

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Changes
- **Lists Model**: Added `sharedWith: string[]` field for user IDs with access
- **Permissions**: All APIs now check for both ownership AND shared access

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/share-list` - Share a list with another user via email
- Updated all list/todo APIs to support shared access permissions

### Socket Events
- `join-list` / `leave-list` - Room management
- `todo-added` / `todo-updated` / `todo-deleted` - Real-time sync
- `list-updated` - For list-level changes

### Client-Side Components
- **ShareModal**: Email input with Clerk user validation
- **SocketProvider**: WebSocket context for real-time features
- **Updated Todo Pages**: Integrated socket events with all CRUD operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure your `.env.local` has the required Clerk credentials
2. Start the server: `npm run dev`
3. The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` with WebSocket support
4. Create lists, share them, and see real-time updates in action!

## 🧪 Testing the Features

1. **Test Sharing:**
   - Register two different users in Clerk
   - Create a list with one user
   - Share it with the second user's email
   - Login as the second user to see the shared list

2. **Test Real-Time Sync:**
   - Open the same list in two browser windows (different users)
   - Add/edit/delete todos in one window
   - Watch changes appear instantly in the other window
